                    <h3>App Permissions and Why We Need Them</h3>
                    <p>The Application requests certain permissions to enable its core features. We do not use these permissions for any purpose other than what is stated below:</p>
                    
                    <div class="permission-item">
                        <h4>Notification Listener Service (BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE):</h4>
                        <p>This permission is required for the "Stop Audio & Video" feature. It allows the Application to detect which media apps are currently playing audio so it can correctly stop them when the timer ends. We do not read or store the content of your notifications.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="permission-item">
                        <h4>Device Administrator (BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN):</h4>
                        <p>This permission is required only for the "Screen Off" feature. You must manually grant this permission. It allows the Application to programmatically lock the screen when the timer ends. The Application does not use this permission for any other purpose.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="permission-item">
                        <h4>Post Notifications:</h4>
                        <p>This permission is required to show the persistent notification that displays the remaining time and allows you to control the timer.</p>
                    </div>
